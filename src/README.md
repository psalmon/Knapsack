Dynamic Programming solution to the common Knapsack problem.
This is not thoroughly tested, though I believe it works.

Usage:
Command line arg[0] is the number of items you want to consider.
Command line arg[1] is the maximum weight the knapsack can hold (whole number integer).

Output is printed in table format for whether or not the item will be taken.
